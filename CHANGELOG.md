# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes should be recorded here.

This project does not yet promise stable semver compatibility for every API;
the public room APIs and the `hmctl` CLI are the intended compatibility
surface.

## Unreleased

- **Breaking — internal endpoints retired or renamed.** Five `/v1/_internal/*`
  routes that were never part of the supported surface were deleted
  (`scope-attest`, `query/run/submit`, `agents/register-image`, `agents/submit`,
  `index`). The remaining two were promoted to documented public routes,
  with one POST verb dropped:
  - `/v1/_internal/store` → `POST /v1/tenant/sql`
  - `/v1/_internal/tokens` GET/DELETE → `GET /v1/tenant/tokens` and
    `DELETE /v1/tenant/tokens/{token_id}`. The `POST /v1/_internal/tokens`
    mint endpoint was deleted — `POST /v1/rooms` is the supported way to
    issue a capability token, and it returns the plaintext token once. The
    `scripts/smoke_capability_tokens.py` lifecycle script was removed with
    it.
- **Breaking — index agent feature removed.** The "index" agent role is gone:
  the `IndexRequest`/`IndexResponse` models, `Pipeline.run_index` and
  `run_index_tracked`, the `index_agent_id` / `index_started_at` /
  `index_ended_at` / `index_output` columns on `_hivemind_query_runs`, the
  `default_index_agent` / `default_index_image` / `index_model` settings, and
  the `default-index` autoload spec are all removed. `agent_type` now accepts
  `scope | query | mediator` only. The bundled three-archive submit endpoint
  was the only entry point and is gone with the rest.
- Added repository hygiene docs: contributing guide, security policy, changelog,
  and GitHub issue templates.
- Added README badges and a shorter top-level capability summary.
